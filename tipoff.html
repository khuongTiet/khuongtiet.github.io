              I had always had an interest in basketball that I believe stemmed from my youth when I would play with my friends during school.
              I feel that basketball is one of the easier sports to follow along during a play but you could easily get lost if you aren't watching a highlight.
              The main obstacle that gets into people's way is knowing which player is which and what a certain play means for the overall game.
              I think that once you get over this initial learning curve, basketball is really exciting to follow and is easily kept up with.

              I wanted to provide a sort of personal experience with TipOff. I want the users to have a specific goal in mind when they start using TipOff. With this
              in mind, I had decided to develop TipOff as a mobile application. Initally, I had planned to develop it as a web application that is responsive, but
              I did not think that people would want to start learning how to watch basketball while they're sitting down on a computer.
