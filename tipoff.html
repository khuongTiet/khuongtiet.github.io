              I had always had an interest in basketball that I believe stemmed from my youth when I would play with my friends during school.
              I feel that basketball is one of the easier sports to follow along during a play but you could easily get lost if you aren't watching a highlight.
              The main obstacle that gets into people's way is knowing which player is which and what a certain play means for the overall game.
              I think that once you get over this initial learning curve, basketball is really exciting to follow and is easily kept up with.

              I wanted to provide a sort of personal experience with TipOff. I want the users to have a specific goal in mind when they start using TipOff. With this
              in mind, I had decided to develop TipOff as a mobile application. Initally, I had planned to develop it as a web application that is responsive, but
              I did not think that people would want to start learning how to watch basketball while they're sitting down on a computer. I had some experience developing
              in React from my internship at the Portal but I didn't have any experience developing in React Native at all so this project was something that would really
              test my abilities.

              I decided to start small and simple. It would be better to have something to start from than to worry about the details and optimizing it before it can even
              be finished and tested on. I focused on designing a screen that would show users how the point system would work and that proved to be pretty challenging to do.

              Initially, I had tried to desin the court using the basic HTML/CSS designs but due to the constraints within React Native, designing a basketball court is
              pretty difficult in just HTML/CSS. After some researching, I had decided to try using SVGs because they would let me define a path and from that, I could
              map out a basketball court. It was very interesting learning how to use SVG since its like using a virtual pen that is guided by coordinates and I hope
              I could expand more on that in my future projects.

            </div>

              After I had the rough prototype set up, I set out on using libraries to supplement and expedite my development of the UI for the project. I used
              Native Base by Geeky Ants in order to have a uniform UI experience across mobile device operating systems. Learning to use the components within this
              library was a bit confusing due to the documentation not being up to date with what the actual parameters were for the components but I slowly got the hang of it.
              Using the library really helped me take my mind off the design aspect of the project and focus more on the experience. I  began to question the placement of my
              screens and even asked some of my friends about the placement of certain buttons.

              The future of TipOff is a bit uncertain due to the fact that, in my opinion, in order for the application to be engaging I would require additional
              assets such as logos and vector images that relate to the NBA. These, however, cannot be used for public or commercial use, so that if I were to
              want to publish this application some day, I would have to apply for licensing to use the logos of the NBA. This was a bit of a disappointment since
              I was really excited to share this application with the public one day, and have more people learn about and watch the NBA. I would try to see how I
              might apply for licensing to use the logos in the application or perhaps just use free source vector images that depict basketball to get around this
              obstacle. I definitely will come back to touch up and improve upon the functionalities of the application because it is a good learning experience and
              practice for me in developing with React Native.
