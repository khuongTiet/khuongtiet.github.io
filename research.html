                The user interviews really helped me gauge what people expected to see in a portfolio. The consensus was that most people thought of a portfolio as a visual representation
                of your resume. As such I designed my portfolio to fit this sort of format. I do feel that the interview questions strongly leaned towards an overall grasp rather than
                personal questions and input. I decided to conduct my interviews across a wide range of people. I interviewed fellow students in the class, a person within the overarching
                school of Computer Science but not in the same department, as well as a person that is majoring in Fashion. I feel like for any kind of work that involves design, there
                will be a portfolio so it would be good practice to hear what kinds of inputs these people would have. Portfolios are visual so I feel like the answers that I received
                from the fashion major really helped me shape out the design for my portfolio.

                A competitor analysis is a look at the peers that are doing what you want to be doing. It's essentially scoping out the competition to gain insight on what to do.
                Conducting competitor analyses also assisted heavily in how I wanted to style and format my website. Of course I had an idea of what I wanted but there are just so many
                ways of laying out a website that I needed inspiration to draw from. I wanted to stray away from the very basic Bootstrap-esque layout with the hero image and three sections
                with a fixed navigation bar at the top. I found a nice middle ground between that and something new. The biggest inspiration that I had draw from was a film studios' website.

                A feature value matrix is a chart of features that you would want to implement along with a scoring system on how valuable it is to you.
                The features that I picked were ones that you would expect to see on a resume. I wanted to have a navigation bar because I feel like that is something that is
                expected by now so I had to have it. Having a picture of myself was important as well because I want the person viewing the portfolio to attribute all that they
                see to a face. It was a bit difficult scoring each feature because I already had in mind what I wanted so the scoring might have been a bit biased towards
                certain ones. In the future I believe that I would come into this process without having a set of features that I would want to implement before hand and
                gather the features during the process not before. That is not to say its bad practice to have some features that I would want to see in the end design but
                for the gathering stage I feel that it would help me if I came into the process with a clean mind and a clean slate with nothing to compare to.

                I prioritized on the features that I felt like could have been done realistically in the time frame that I had, as well as based upon how much I wanted them.
                Using the value scores from the feature value matrix helped in deciding which ones to implement but I also had my own judgement in which ones to pick. Prioritizing
                features really helps you with the way you think about how you want to layout the interface. Having a set of features in mind helps you build out the core of what
                you think you would want, and then you can add on additional features as you see fit. This is how I approached the rest of my portfolio after really deciding upon
                core features that I wanted to keep no matter what.

                User stories are vital to the creation of any product or design. They're what helps you drive your overall design and really lets you have a look
                into what you should be producing. By having user stories you are able to forge your design into something that guides users and helps to get
                what they really need out of your design. The way I arrived at creating my user stories was to have a look at my features, decide what kind of
                user would be likely to want or use that feature, and then I would go ahead and try to find that feature as if I were that user. I put myself in the
                user's shoes and set out with a goal in mind to use that feature. This way really helped me visualize what kind of interactions would be happening
                at each section of my portfolio.

                A cognitive walkthough is essentially leading a user through your work, giving them instructions or tasks to do something, and then taking note
                of how they interact with it and the outcome of the tasks. Cognitive walkthroughs really help with actually seeing how a user interacts with your
                design first hand and really showcases the strengths and weaknesses of what you have designed. There were some cases in which conducting the
                cognitive walkthrough was a bit frustrating because I knew how the portfolio worked and I had the design in mind but of course that did not
                translate well into how other people would see and use the site. It was a very good exercise to conduct the walkthroughs though as they really
                helped me see the biggest flaws in my design and really assisted in the overall redesign of the portfolio.

                For the user tests, I had chosen to use a navigation test and a 5 second visual test. I feel like initially I knew that one of the main problems
                with my previous design was the visuals of it. I felt like the colors were clashing so I wanted to have users try to navigate through the site and
                let me know what they thought about the overall design and color scheme that I had. The tests really helped me understand where users would
                initially look for certain sections in my portfolio as well as helping me get the opinions of people on the coloring that I had set up for
                my sections. It really helped that some of my tests were anonymous as it allowed the test taker to have free reign in terms of how they would
                critique me as I believe nothing really comes from kind and sweet critique. Challenges that I had come to terms with were how limited I was able
                to actually test and see the results for the test. I feel that the way I had tested the portfolio was a half hearted cognitive walkthrough and that
                I would have had more cognitive walkthroughs to base my work off of instead of conducting these kinds of tests. Certainly a different type of test would
                have proven more useful but I did not go down that route during this process.
